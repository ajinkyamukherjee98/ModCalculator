# ModCalculator
The following python code helps a user perform modulo arithmetics

I have used a Simple GUIusing tkinter in python to generate a modulo calculator for fomrulas x^a mod p
This Formular does not abide by the laws of Cyprotgrahpic Finite Groups for which you need to use Group Properties to calcuate the values

I have commented the section for such a problem and if a user wants to calculate the value of a large number under spcific groups they can uncomment that section and use it to get the correct values.
